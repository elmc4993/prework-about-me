      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work in clinical research, but I'm looking for a career change. I've been told that I have a strange sense of humor.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I don't like the sun, so in a cruel twist of fate I was born and raised here in Central Florida.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like hiking, watching horror movies, and reading (mostly mystery novels and history documentaries)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to have the freedom to travel someday and do remote work.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Maitland (near Winter Park) with my handsome boyfriend and even more handsome cat.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Logic problems have always appealed to me, and to me web development seems like a giant and potentially very productive logic puzzle.</p>
